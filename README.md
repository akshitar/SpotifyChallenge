### We use this data to gain insight into user behavior and suggest some product changes, or a combination.

*Part 1*:  
Determining whether male and female listeners are significantly different in their overall listening (in terms of the count of track listens, or in terms of the total time spent listening).

*Part 2*:  
Break the user listening into sessions (first defining what a listening session is). Look for correlations between user demographic features (or their behavior) and their overall listening, or their average session lengths.

*Part 3*:  
Cluster user categories that describes some interesting or useful behavior traits.
